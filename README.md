## ðŸ’» What is this?

A dead simple landing page for a tool that gives you emotional validation for doing the bare minimum.  
Because you deserve it. (Well, maybe. We're not checking.)

Built with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because of course it is  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for cozy pixel vibes  
- No analytics, no pressure, just pixels

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- One button. That's it.  
- Minimal CSS. Minimal effort.  
- Sarcasm included, no additional configuration required.  
- Absolutely no business model.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

In case you want to stare at validation in high resolution.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation (if you're into that)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/bare-minimum-landing.git
cd bare-minimum-landing
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
But let's be honest, you're probably not cloning this. And that's okay.

## ðŸ“± Coming Soon

Android? Maybe.

iOS? That's between us and Apple.

Mental stability? Unlikely.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Some days you're not a rockstar.
You're not a ninja.
You're not even a "disruptor."

You're just here.
And that's enough.
